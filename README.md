#Fancy Project Playbook
These are some documents that we use at Fancy Ventures to quickly start, develop & market a new project.

## Team communication
We use [Slack](slack.com) with following extensions. All bots are pushing messages in our #notifications channel so all other channels don´t get distracted.

- Github: https://slack.com/apps/A0F7YS2SX-github
- Google Analytics stats: https://slack.com/apps/A0G0Q15F1-arc
- Mailchimp: https://slack.com/apps/A0F82E726-mailchimp
- New Relic: https://slack.com/apps/A0F827KK2-new-relic
- Twitter: https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDW93-twitter
- Smooch (See customer support)
- For our own services (ruby): https://github.com/mklb/how-to-post-to-slack-ruby
- For new time logging events with toggl: https://zapier.com/zapbook/slack/toggl/

## Customer support
- Best solution we found so far: [Smooch](https://smooch.io)! Connect FB Messenger, web chat, email etc with Slack
- (Just) Talk with visitors on your website: https://chatra.io

## Knowledge Management
Write every process you learned/developed down if it´s like that someone has to repeat these steps.
- https://getguru.com offers a nice web app and browser extension to easly access and manage knowledge

## Timetracking
We use [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) which is free for teams up to 5 people. It has a web version, mobile apps and a Trello/Chrome extension

## TODO tools
We use [Trello](https://trello.com) with these (default) boards and a [Toggle integration](https://toggl.com/trello-time-tracking)
- "New -> Uncategorized": for new incomming, unsorted tasks
