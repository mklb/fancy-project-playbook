#Fancy Project Playbook
These are some documents that we use at Fancy Ventures to quickly start, develop & market a new project.

## Team communication
We use [Slack](slack.com) with following extensions. All bots are pushing messages in our #notifications channel so all other channels don´t get distracted.

## Customer support
- Best solution we found so far: [Smooch](https://smooch.io)! Connect FB Messenger, web chat, email etc with Slack

## Knowledge Management
Write every process you learned/developed down if it´s like that someone has to repeat these steps.
- https://getguru.com offers a nice web app and browser extension to easly access and manage knowledge

## TODO tools
We use [Trello](https://trello.com) with these (default) boards and a [Toggle integration](https://toggl.com/trello-time-tracking)
- "New -> Uncategorized": for new incomming, unsorted tasks
