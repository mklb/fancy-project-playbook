# The Unfair Advantage (Pre)Launch List

This is "The Unfair Advantage (Pre)Launch List" for entrepreneurs and startups. Launch your product / service the right way with this list of useful links and generate hundreds of leads. Now including some fancy growth hacking resources, too!

I hope it will save you some hours of research for your next launch. Feel free to contribute to this list.

## Curious if it works?
I hope so.. we will see.

I am working on a new product / service (web & iOS App) right now. This is my first time that I will launch something with a strategy behind it. So this is why I did the whole research.

I´ll use this exact list to get the word out. I will try to track every lead, track the amount of time I spend while going through this list and if you are interested I will keep you updated via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/justawebguy).

Somehow this is a big experiment. I hope I will / we will learn something here.
